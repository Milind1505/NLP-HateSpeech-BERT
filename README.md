# NLP-HateSpeech-BERT: Hate Speech and Offensive Language Detection using BERT

## Project Overview

This project focuses on developing a robust model for detecting hate speech and offensive language in online text using the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) architecture and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. 

Hate speech and offensive language are prevalent issues on online platforms, posing significant risks to individuals and communities. Automated detection models play a crucial role in mitigating these risks by identifying and flagging harmful content for moderation.

This project aims to build and evaluate such a model, demonstrating its effectiveness in classifying text into three categories: "Hate Speech," "Offensive Language," and "Neither."

## Dataset

The model is trained and evaluated using a labeled dataset of tweets containing instances of hate speech, offensive language, and neutral language. The dataset source and any preprocessing steps are described in the data folder.

## Methodology

1. Data Preprocessing: The dataset undergoes preprocessing, including cleaning, tokenization, and splitting into training, validation, and test sets.
2. Model Selection: The BERT base uncased model is selected for its strong performance in text classification tasks.
3. Fine-tuning: The BERT model is fine-tuned on the labeled hate speech dataset to optimize its performance for this specific task.
4. Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and a confusion matrix to analyze its strengths and weaknesses.

## Results

The model achieves [insert your model's performance metrics here, e.g., an accuracy of X%, F1-score of Y%]. The evaluation results and confusion matrix are available in the evaluation folder.

## Conclusion

The findings demonstrate the effectiveness of using BERT and NLP techniques for hate speech and offensive language detection. The model has the potential to contribute to safer online spaces by automating the identification of harmful content. 

## Future Work

Potential future improvements include:
* Exploring different fine-tuning strategies and hyperparameter optimization.
* Incorporating additional features like sentiment analysis or linguistic patterns.
* Addressing potential biases in the model and data.
* Scaling the model for real-world applications and large datasets.

## Usage

Instructions for running the code and using the model are provided in the code folder.
